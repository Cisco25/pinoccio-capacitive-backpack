Pinoccio Capacitive Backpack
============================
Circuit, code and information about the (non-official) Pinoccio capacitive backpack

To get started with P-I-N-O capacitive touches:
- Jump 4x resistors footprints R2 to R5
- Solder 4x 1MOhm resistors 0603 size onto C2 to C5 footprints
- Download and install ArduinoCapSense library: http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor?from=Main.CapSense
- Plug backpack and upload sketch CapTouch_PINO to scout using Arduino IDE (the one version recommended by Pinoccio)
- Enjoy!

To get started with slider:
- Jump 3x resistors footprints R7 to R9
- Solder 3x 1MOhm resistors 0603 size onto C7 to C9 footprints
- Download and install ArduinoCapSense library: http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor?from=Main.CapSense
- Plug backpack and upload sketch CapTouch to scout using Arduino IDE (the one version recommended by Pinoccio)
- Enjoy!
