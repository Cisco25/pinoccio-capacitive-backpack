Pinoccio Capacitive Backpack
============================
Circuit, code and information about the (non-official) Pinoccio capacitive backpack

To get started with P-I-N-O capacitive touches:
- Jump resistors footprints R2 to R5
- Use 4x 1MOhm resistors 0603 size and solder in place of C2 to C5 pads
- Download and install ArduinoCapSense library: http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor?from=Main.CapSense
- Plug backpack and upload sketch to scout using Arduino IDE (the one version recommended by Pinoccio)
- Enjoy!
